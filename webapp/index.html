<p>Supply chain management is the practice of coordinating the various activities necessary to produce and deliver goods and services to a business's customers.
The five basic components of supply chain management are procurement, production, inventory, distribution, and customer service. 
Each of these components plays an important role in the overall success of the supply chain.</p>
<h2>Why Is Supply Chain Management Important?</h2>
<p>Supply chain management is important because it can help achieve several business objectives. 
For instance, controlling manufacturing processes can improve product quality, reducing the risk of recalls and lawsuits while helping to build a strong consumer brand. At the same time, 
controls over shipping procedures can improve customer service by avoiding costly shortages or periods of inventory over supply. 
Overall, supply chain management provides several opportunities for companies to improve their profit margins and is especially important for companies with large and international operations.</p>
<h2>How Are Ethics and Supply Chain Management Related?</h2>
<p>Ethics has become an increasingly important aspect of supply chain management, 
so much so that a set of principles called supply chain ethics was born. 
Consumers and investors are invested in how companies produce their products, 
treat their work-force, and protect the environment. As a result, companies respond by instituting measures to reduce waste, 
improve working conditions, and lessen the impact on the environment.</p>
